# PhD-Shortlist-Algorithm-GUI
I made an algorithm to sort candidates seeking to enroll in PhD programs offered by IIT ROORKEE.
The code is written in Matlab and requires a .xlsx file consisting of all the candidates who applied for PhD in IIT ROORKEE to shortlist from.
The code consists of 3 phases:
1. Shortlisting - Divides the Candidates based on category and subject preference.
2. Scrutiny Shortlisting - Shortlists the divided candidates based on College Guidelines.
3. Final Shortlisting - Shortlists candidates further based on scores set by the professor  

GUI.mlapp has all the source code.
Sample.xlsx is the Sample format for candidates list.
GUI Images has consists of Images of GUI in action.
